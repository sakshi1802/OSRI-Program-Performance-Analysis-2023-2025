# OSRI Program Performance Analysis (2023–2025)

## Overview
This analysis was completed as part of my role as a Data & Digital Transformation Graduate Assistant at the Office of Student Research and Innovation (OSRI), California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB).
The goal of this project was to identify low-performing research programs based on engagement and funding metrics and recommend which programs should be discontinued or redesigned for the 2025–2026 academic year to optimize funding and strategic impact.

## Business Context
The Office of Student Research and Innovation funds and supports multiple student research programs each year. Leadership needed visibility into which programs were driving the most student engagement and funding efficiency, and which were no longer delivering sufficient impact.
This analysis provided data-backed recommendations to guide program funding, restructuring, and resource allocation for the upcoming academic cycle.

## Business Questions
1. Which programs demonstrated consistent student engagement and funding performance from 2023–2025?
2. Which programs showed decline or low participation over time?
3. Which programs should OSRI continue, redesign, or discontinue to improve impact in 2025–2026?

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and consolidated program, participation, and funding data from 2023–2025.  
2. **Data Analysis**: Identified trends, top-performing programs, and year-over-year changes.  
3. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards highlighting key metrics and comparative insights.  
4. **DAX Measures**: Built calculations for totals, summaries, and trend analysis.  

## Key Insights
- **Total Students Served**: 1,953  
- **Total Funding Awarded**: $362.35K  
- **Top Program by Participation**: Workshops (544 students)  
- **Programs with Notable Growth**: Workshops, ASI Student Research & Travel  
- **Programs with Declining Engagement**: Peer Lab Program, Coyote Research Ambassadors
- *Note: Data reflects only active programs for each year; some programs did not run all three years.*  

## Recommendations
- Continue & Expand: Workshops and ASI Student Research & Travel — both programs demonstrated strong engagement and steady growth.\
- Discontinue or Redesign: Peer Lab Program and Coyote Research Ambassadors — participation dropped year over year with limited return on funding.
- Reallocate Resources: Shift budget and staffing toward programs that consistently attract students and deliver measurable outcomes.

## Tools & Skills
- Power BI: Data modeling, DAX measures, KPI dashboards
- Excel: Data cleaning and preparation
- Business Analysis: Identifying performance trends to support funding decisions
- Data Storytelling: Communicating insights and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders

## My Role
As a Graduate Assistant in Data & Digital Transformation, I independently designed and delivered this analysis to inform OSRI’s 2025–2026 program planning.
The findings directly supported leadership discussions on which programs to continue, restructure, or sunset based on data-driven evidence.
